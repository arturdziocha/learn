 * We need your help to improve an adaptive system. Write a program that asks learners what programming language they are learning. I hope you know which answer is correct.

Question: what programming language are you learning here?

Java
Kotlin
Scala
Python
The program should read the answerâ€™s number from the standard input and output the result of the test: "Yes!", "No!" or "Unknown number".

Sample Input 1:

1
Sample Output 1:

Yes!
Sample Input 2:

6
Sample Output 2:

Unknown number
